        "What is RTOS?,\"A Real-Time Operating System is described specifically as an OS used for applications where data must be processed within a fixed and small measure of time, and examples given include air-traffic control systems, anti-lock braking systems, and heart pacemakers.\"\n",
        "What is process synchronization?,\"Process synchronization is defined as the mechanism used to coordinate processes that share resources to maintain data consistency, achieved through mutual exclusion between independent and cooperative processes.\"\n",
        "What is IPC?,\"Interprocess Communication is defined as a mechanism where processes exchange data using OS-approved methods such as pipes, message queues, semaphores, sockets, shared memory, and signals.\"\n",
        "What is the difference between main memory and secondary memory?,\"Main memory is defined as volatile read-write memory accessed directly by the processing unit, whereas secondary memory is non-volatile storage requiring data to be transferred to primary memory before CPU access and accessed only via I/O channels.\"\n",
        "What is virtual memory?,\"Virtual memory is described as a memory management technique that creates the illusion of a very large main memory by storing programs as pages and managing them through paging or segmentation.\"\n",
        "What is a thread?,\"A thread is defined as a basic unit of CPU utilization that consists of a program counter, thread identifier, stack, and a set of registers, enabling improved performance through parallelism and reduced context-switching overhead.\"\n",
        "What is FCFS?,\"FCFS is described as a scheduling algorithm in which the process that arrives first is executed first, following a strictly non-preemptive order.\"\n",
        "What is thrashing?,\"Thrashing occurs when excessive paging operations significantly reduce CPU utilization because the system spends more time swapping pages than executing processes due to improper memory allocation.\"\n",
        "What is a deadlock?,\"A deadlock is defined as a state where processes wait indefinitely for resources held by one another, arising only when the four necessary conditions—mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait—are simultaneously present.\"\n",
        "What is spooling?,\"Spooling is defined as the technique of storing data temporarily for devices that operate at different speeds, such as printers, allowing the OS to manage data flow independently of the device's processing rate.\"\n",
        "What is a time-sharing system?,\"A time-sharing system is described as an OS that allows multiple users to share computer resources simultaneously by rapidly switching the CPU among them to provide interactive response times.\"\n",
        "What is context switching?,\"Context switching is defined specifically as saving the state of a currently running process and loading the saved state of another process, allowing multitasking by the OS.\"\n",
        "What is SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing)?,\"SMP is defined as an architecture in which multiple processors share a single operating system and memory, and all processors are treated equally and run in parallel.\"\n",
        "Explain the difference between kernel and OS?,\"The kernel is defined as the core component of the system responsible for low-level operations like scheduling, memory management, and device handling, whereas the operating system includes the kernel plus all supporting system software and utilities.\"\n",

Spooling is used to mediate between a computer application and a slow peripheral device by allowing them to access or acquire data at different rates, using a disk as a large buffer. This process helps overlap I/O operations for one task with processor operations for another task efficiently.\n",
